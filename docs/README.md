Welcome to the Python Template created via a cookiecutter recipe. The project template is designed for a development via a `Double Loop approach` (BDD-TDD) using pytest and several other pytest libs.

## Description

### A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

### Task

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

> _In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself._

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

### Examples

```
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false
```
